<!-- This sample shows the event parameters, and their values, when beforeExport event is triggered-->
<div id="indicatorDiv">Event name: <b> beforeExport </b> 
    <br>
    <br>Triggered just before the exporting process of a chart begins, through the export context menu or when the exportChart() method is called programmatically.</br>
    <br>All events, when triggered, will provide two parameters for the handler - <b> eventObj </b> (object containing information generic to all events) and <b> dataObj </b> (object containing information specific to an event).</br>
    <br>Click the <b> Export Chart </b> button, in the top-right corner of the chart (<i> you may have to increase the width of the Result pane to access the button </i>). From the menu, <b> select the format </b> in which the chart has to be exported. The beforeExport event is created after you select a format and just before the export process begins.</br>
    <br>Scroll down to the table rendered below the chart to view information contained in the dataObj object. To view information contained in the eventObj object, open the console.</br>
